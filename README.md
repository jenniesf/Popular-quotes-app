<h2>Overview</h2>
I built a full-stack CRUD application to track my favorite & popular quotes stored in a MongoDB database. <br>
My application is hosted on Heroku.

<h2>My Process</h2>
<h3>Built With:</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>HTML</li>
  <li>CSS</li>
  <li>MongoDB</li>
  <li>Node.js</li>
  <li>Express</li>
  <li>EJS</li>
</ul>

<h3>How It Works</h3>
Upon entering a name and quote and clicking the button, the quote/name data is stored in a MongoDB database.
The page is redirected (aka refreshed) and the new name/quote is shown on the page. 
Additionally, the user can 'like' and 'delete' names/quotes from the page and database by clicking the 'thumbs up' and 'trash' icons. 
The number of 'likes' on the page will increase by 1 upon each 'thumbs up' click. 

<h3>What I Learned</h3> 
I learned about databases and related functions, such as creating, reading, deleting and updating data. 
Also, I learned about object-oriented databases, how to sort data and enter things into the DOM. 

<h3>Optimizations:</h3>
I would like to provide the following future features/optimizations:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>User login and authentication - create userbase for each user</li>
  <li>Name and quote suggestion and auto-complete</li>
  <li>Use a UI framework (bootstrap) to redesign the look of the website</li>
</ul>
